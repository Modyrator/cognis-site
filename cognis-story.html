      <h1>Cognis</h1>
      <h2>The Soul of Invention</h2>

      <p>
        The halls of the Aether Conservatory buzzed with energy—arcane engines
        hummed behind stone walls, quills whispered across parchment, and
        illusionary diagrams spun in midair. Among the lecture chambers and
        levitating labs, one name passed from mouth to mouth:
      </p>

      <p><strong>Faydric Tomaix.</strong></p>

      <p>
        He wasn't much to look at—lanky, too young, hands perpetually
        ink-stained. But when he spoke, professors listened. When he drafted,
        artificers copied. Students older than him turned pages in silence,
        their pride quietly choking on his brilliance. At just twenty-one,
        Faydric had already filed three patents with the Aetheric Invention
        Registry and corrected a ten-year error in golemic sympathetic linkage
        theory. Beneath one margin, he had scribbled
        <span class="clue" title="Axiom">axiom-driven constructs</span>, noting
        "require no handler, only clarity of thought." No one questioned whether
        he would change the world. Only how long they’d have to wait.
      </p>

      <p>
        But then came the shaking hands. Missed words. Equations that once
        flowed like music now faltered on the page. Faydric said little—only
        that it was “temporary.” Those close to him knew better.
      </p>

      <p>
        Late one evening, as twilight drenched the Assembly in violet-blue,
        Faydric stood before an arcanobiologist in a quiet consultation chamber.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “Your neural lattice is unraveling,” the mage murmured, unable to meet
        his gaze. “We don’t understand the source. Magical. Degenerative. You
        have… months, maybe a few years of lucidity. I’m sorry.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Faydric didn’t speak. He simply stared at his reflection in the
        silver-rimmed mirror behind the healer—eyes sharp, young, burning with
        questions. Then he left.
      </p>

      <p>He didn’t slow down.</p>

      <p>
        In the weeks that followed, lights flickered from beneath the old
        observatory dome—abandoned for decades, now sealed from the inside.
        Rumors grew. Faydric stopped attending lectures. He declined
        appointments, missed presentations. But the hum of power from beneath
        the dome grew stronger.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside, the prodigy labored in secret. Not to save his body—but to
        preserve what truly mattered: his mind. Schematics filled the
        walls—runes layered over mechanical joints, soul-threading rituals
        paired with psionic extraction arrays, and the rarely taught principle
        of
        <span class="clue" title="Mody">Modus Constructae</span>.
      </p>

      <p>He named it Project Cognis.</p>

      <p>
        The construct shell stood tall in the moonlight, brass-limned and inert,
        surrounded by an array of crystal memory cores. Its chest housed a
        lattice of blue energy—an arcane synapse chamber tuned to one frequency:
        Faydric’s own.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "Cognition is continuity. If the mind persists, then so do I."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        They found his body weeks later—slumped beside the transfer circle,
        mouth parted, fingers curled around a broken focus crystal.
      </p>

      <p>And the construct? Gone.</p>

      <h2>Now</h2>

      <p>
        In the wilds beyond the city-states, rumors whisper of a cloaked figure
        of brass and blue fire—a thing that speaks with a young man’s voice and
        the weight of a scholar’s memory. Some say it builds marvels from scrap.
        Others say it communes with spirits of lost knowledge. A few claim it
        remembers who it was. In some remote camps, travelers claim it is a
        living
        <span class="clue" title="Artifact"><em>artifact</em></span
        >, shaped not by hands, but by will—a relic with purpose.
      </p>

      <p>He calls himself Cognis.</p>

      <p>
        He does not sleep. He does not forget. He studies still, refining the
        line between soul and spark. Where he walks, machines bloom like iron
        flowers, and questions hang heavier than answers.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “Am I Faydric, or the echo of his ambition?”<br />
        “Can memory become a soul… or only a shadow of one?”
      </blockquote>

      <p>He doesn't ask for pity. He just wants to know.</p>
