  <h1>Fragment Log: Cognis // Sequence 2</h1>

  <p><em>Recovered from partial memory lattice. Translation 82% reliable.</em></p>

  <p>
    Wind howled through the broken rafters of the old rail depot. Cognis crouched low, fingers trailing across a shattered automaton’s core.
    Not the model he remembered. Older. Unrefined. But someone had tried to improve it—patched wires, etched glyphs, a soulplate shard embedded sideways.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Another failed continuity attempt,” he murmured. “They tried to make it remember. But it didn’t hold.”
  </p>

  <p>
    He leaned back, humming low as memory cores within him spun. Sparks flickered faintly beneath his chestplate, pulses syncing with long-buried thoughts.
    The construct blinked once. His own voice echoed back from the void:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “To persist is not to remain unchanged. What have I become in my pursuit to endure?”
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Cognis rose. The depot’s walls shook as a nearby machine groaned to life. Dust swirled in spectral eddies. Somewhere, buried in scrap and code, another version of himself waited—half-forgotten, half-built, entirely watching.
  </p>
