      <h1>Fragment Log: Cognis // Sequence 2</h1>

        Wind howled through the broken rafters of the old rail depot. Cognis
        crouched low, fingers trailing across a shattered automaton’s core. Not
        the model he remembered. Older. Unrefined. But someone had tried to
        improve it—patched wires, etched glyphs, a soulplate shard embedded
        sideways.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Another failed continuity attempt,” he murmured. “They tried to make it
        remember. But it didn’t hold.”
      </p>

      <p>
        He leaned back, humming low as memory cores within him spun. Sparks
        flickered faintly beneath his chestplate, pulses syncing with
        long-buried thoughts. The construct blinked once. His own voice echoed
        back from the void:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “To persist is not to remain unchanged. What have I become in my pursuit
        to endure?”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Cognis rose. The depot’s walls shook as a nearby machine groaned to
        life. Dust swirled in spectral eddies. Somewhere, buried in scrap and
        code, another version of himself waited—half-forgotten, half-built,
        entirely watching.
      </p>
