    <h1>Cognis</h1>
    <h2>The Soul of Invention</h2>

    <p>
      The halls of the Aether Conservatory buzzed with energy—arcane engines
      hummed behind stone walls, quills whispered across parchment, and
      illusionary diagrams spun in midair. Among the lecture chambers and
      levitating labs, one name passed from mouth to mouth:
    </p>

    <p><strong>Faydric Tomaix.</strong></p>

    <p>
      He wasn't much to look at—lanky, too young, hands perpetually ink-stained.
      But when he spoke, professors listened. When he drafted, artificers
      copied. Students older than him turned pages in silence, their pride
      quietly choking on his brilliance. At just twenty-one, Faydric had already
      filed three patents with the Aetheric Invention Registry and corrected a
      ten-year error in golemic sympathetic linkage theory. No one questioned
      whether he would change the world. Only how long they’d have to wait.
    </p>

    <p>
      But then came the shaking hands. Missed words. Equations that once flowed
      like music now faltered on the page. Faydric said little—only that it was
      “temporary.” Those close to him knew better.
    </p>

    <p>
      Late one evening, as twilight drenched the Assembly in violet-blue,
      Faydric stood before an arcanobiologist in a quiet consultation chamber.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Your neural lattice is unraveling,” the mage murmured, unable to meet his
      gaze. “We don’t understand the source. Magical. Degenerative. You have…
      months, maybe a few years of lucidity. I’m sorry.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Faydric didn’t speak. He simply stared at his reflection in the
      silver-rimmed mirror behind the healer—eyes sharp, young, burning with
      questions. Then he left.
    </p>

    <div class="timestamp">[02:18]</div>

    <p>He didn’t slow down.</p>

    <p>
      In the weeks that followed, lights flickered from beneath the old
      observatory dome—abandoned for decades, now sealed from the inside. Rumors
      grew. Faydric stopped attending lectures. He declined appointments, missed
      presentations. But the hum of power from beneath the dome grew stronger.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inside, the prodigy labored in secret. Not to save his body—but to
      preserve what truly mattered: his mind. Schematics filled the walls—runes
      layered over mechanical joints, soul-threading rituals paired with psionic
      extraction arrays.
    </p>

    <p>He named it Project Cognis.</p>

    <p>
      The construct shell stood tall in the moonlight, brass-limned and inert,
      surrounded by an array of crystal memory cores. Its chest housed a lattice
      of blue energy—an arcane synapse chamber tuned to one frequency: Faydric’s
      own.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "Cognition is continuity. If the mind persists, then so do I."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      They found his body weeks later—slumped beside the transfer circle, mouth
      parted, fingers curled around a broken focus crystal.
    </p>

    <p>And the construct? Gone.</p>

    <div class="timestamp">[02:18]</div>

    <h2>Now</h2>

    <p>
      In the wilds beyond the city-states, rumors whisper of a cloaked figure of
      brass and blue fire—a thing that speaks with a young man’s voice and the
      weight of a scholar’s memory. Some say it builds marvels from scrap.
      Others say it communes with spirits of lost knowledge. A few claim it
      remembers who it was.
    </p>

    <p>He calls himself Cognis.</p>

    <p>
      He does not sleep. He does not forget. He studies still, refining the line
      between soul and spark. Where he walks, machines bloom like iron flowers,
      and questions hang heavier than answers.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Am I Faydric, or the echo of his ambition?”<br />
      “Can memory become a soul… or only a shadow of one?”
    </blockquote>

    <p>He doesn't ask for pity. He just wants to know.</p>
